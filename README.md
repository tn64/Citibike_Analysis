# Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to discover important information about ridership and utilization from publicly available data from Citi Bike in New York. The month of August was chosen because ridership in summer months would show sufficient volume. This provides sufficient volume to determine when the bikes are used, for how long they are used, and who is using them.

# Tools Used:
- Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau

# Results:

## The analysis provides the following information visualized via Tableau Public:

1. The first visualization shows that Citi Bike provides a great option for short tips in New York for all kinds of people. The image below shows the results of two different analyses: Checkout times for users and checkout times by gender.

5. Riders' starting and ending locations are similar across the city, meaning that the company does not have to spend lots of time and money repositioning bikes.

# Summary:

The analysis shows that the Citi Bike bikesharing business in New York City is well organized and well utilized. There seem to be no negative indicators in the NYC data that would be red flags for starting similar bikesharing programs in other cities.

There are other analyses that should be performed on the data:
- Analyses of winter months should be performed and winter conditions compared between New York City and the proposed city.

- Analysis of bike station locatios related to subscribers home and work locations should be performed in order to better understand where to place locations and how many bikes to place at these locations.
